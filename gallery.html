        <h1>PC Building & Technology</h1>
        <p>
            One of Brett’s main interests is working with computers and technology.
            He enjoys building and customizing PC setups, researching parts, and
            putting systems together in a way that makes sense for how they will
            actually be used.
        </p>

        <p>
            PC building is not just about gaming or appearance for Brett. It is a
            hands-on way to problem-solve, test ideas, and understand how different
            components work together. This interest connects closely to his
            background in cybersecurity and his curiosity about how systems function
            at a deeper level.
