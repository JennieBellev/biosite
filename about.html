    <h1>About Brett</h1>
    <p>
        Brett is someone who has always gravitated toward technology and figuring out how things work.
        He holds an associate degree in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics, which reflects his interest
        in problem-solving, systems, and understanding how technology functions behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of formal education and work, Brett enjoys learning on his own by exploring computer
        hardware, testing different components, and improving system performance. He is detail-oriented,
        patient, and tends to approach challenges logically rather than rushing through them.
        These qualities show up both in his technical interests and in how he helps others with
        technology-related questions.
